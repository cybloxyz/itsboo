# 🖐️ Hand Sign & Face Recognition

Hand Sign Recognition with Face Detection is an interactive computer vision project that combines gesture recognition and facial identification into one unified system.
It allows users to control actions or communicate through hand gestures — and even recognizes individual faces for personalization.

This project was inspired by a video about an orphanage filled with amazing children!
I wanted to create a way to communicate and connect with them using technology.
That’s how this project was born — and I’ll keep developing it into version 2 and beyond.

# 🌟 Features

✋ Hand Sign Recognition
Detects and classifies various hand gestures using MediaPipe and OpenCV.

😊 Facial Recognition
Identifies faces using Face Recognition and dlib to personalize interaction.

🧠 Gesture Training Script
Includes a script so you can add and recognize your own custom movements.

💡 Dual Version Support

One version is integrated with Arduino + LCD (for hardware display).

The other version is standalone, so you can run it without Arduino.
