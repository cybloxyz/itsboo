# 🖐️ Hand Sign, Face Recognition & Gestures Piano 🎹🎼

Hand Sign Recognition with Face Detection is an interactive computer vision project that combines gesture recognition and facial identification into one unified system.
It allows users to control actions or communicate through hand gestures — and even recognizes individual faces for personalization.

This project was inspired by a video about an orphanage filled with amazing children!
I wanted to create a way to communicate and connect with them using technology.
That’s how this project was born — and I’ll keep developing it into version 2 and beyond.

and the other one, Gestures Piano is a fun and creative project where you can play a piano with only hand-gesture to camera!
